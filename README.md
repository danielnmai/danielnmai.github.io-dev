My Personal Website Under Construction

Got this published to GitHub with this guide: 
https://medium.com/dailyjs/building-a-react-component-with-webpack-publish-to-npm-deploy-to-github-guide-6927f60b3220

It is built purely on React, compiled with Webpack and transpiled with Babel.

Project started on January 4, 2017.
